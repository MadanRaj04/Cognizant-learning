## 📁 Folder Structure

```

src/
├── CountPeople.js      # Class component with state and logic
├── App.js              # Renders CountPeople
└── index.js            # Main entry point

````

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Create React App

```bash
npx create-react-app counterapp
cd counterapp
````


---

## 🧪 How It Works

* Clicking **Login** increases `entryCount` by 1
* Clicking **Exit** increases `exitCount` by 1
* Counts are updated and displayed in real-time using `setState()`
